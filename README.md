Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis is to breakdown the data to see the peak times and the target users.
Results:
![Peak 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93438483/155861308-43753d6a-1e01-45db-8237-90764852ad65.png)
Peak 1 shows the peak duration being 5 minutes. Riding durations numbers dropping rapidly and the graph. The graph looks flat after the first hour.

![Peak 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93438483/155861431-8cba841f-07d3-40ce-b2d5-2cbd9c03eba6.png)
Peak 2 shows the break down by gender. Men ride bikes at a much higher rate than women.

![Peak 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93438483/155861622-35c82b04-858c-4cb3-8b56-3373a6f73c49.png)
Peak 3 shows the peak day being Thursday with the peak time being 8 am, 5pm, and 6pm.

Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

Men ride bikes almost 3 times as much as women. Peak days are Thursday. I would also break it down by seasons and see how large events impact the rentals.
